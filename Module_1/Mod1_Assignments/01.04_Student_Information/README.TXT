******************************** P M R *********************************************
<+s>: I learned how to use BlueJ to compile and run java programs
      Writing the print statements were easy and there was little debugging required
      
<-s>: Typing out individual print and println statements was very tedius (In some 
           cases i just used \n to skip to the next line within the statement)
************************************************************************************
In the future: I'll try to find more efficient ways to use less statements and still 
being efficient.
